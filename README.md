# Python Basic Projects

This repository contains two small Python projects I created while learning programming basics:

1. **Calculator** - a simple program to perform basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Number Guessing Game** - a game where the computer randomly selects a number and the user tries to guess it.

The goal of these projects is to practice logic, input/output, and basic Python concepts.

I am still learning, but these scripts helped me understand programming fundamentals.
